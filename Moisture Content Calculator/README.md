# Moisture Content Calculator

An excel spreadsheet with which the user can calculate the assumed(theoretical) moisture content of the total mass of the plant-based meat product made from wheat gluten,
miso paste, garlic, nutritional yeast, water as well as negligible spices (paprika powder and black pepper) and its sample of a specific weight. These numbers can then be used
for the potential calibration of the measurement device.
